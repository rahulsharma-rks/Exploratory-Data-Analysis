//////////Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Using Python//////////

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics,often with visual methods.
EDA involves looking at and describing the data set from different angles and then summarizing it.
Data Analysis: Data Analysis is the statistics and probability to figure out trends in the data set. It is used to show historical
data by using some analytics tools. It helps in drilling down the information, to transform metrics, facts, and figures into 
initiatives for improvement.

data = pd.read_csv('StudentsPerformance.csv')
data.head()

data.tail()

data.shape

#Shows columns of the table
data.columns

#Shows unique vales present in dataset
data.nunique()

data['gender'].unique()

#Cleaning the dataset
data.isnull().sum()

Outliers are data points that are far from other data points. Theyâ€™re unusual values in a dataset. Outliers are problematic for 
many statistical analyses because they can cause tests to either miss significant findings or distort real results.

Example: If someone got 69 & other got 75. If someone gets 0, then this is a outlier. It can be due to variability in measurement 
or it may indicate experimental error as well.
It is excluded because it can cause error in statistical analysis.
